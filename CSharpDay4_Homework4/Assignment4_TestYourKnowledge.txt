Generics

Test your knowledge

1] Generics in C# address the problem of code redundancy and type safety. 
They allow you to define classes, methods, and data structures with a placeholder for the type of data they store or use.
Generics help in avoiding boxing and unboxing for value types, provide better performance, and reduce the likelihood of runtime errors.

2] List<string> stringList = new List<string>();

3] The Dictionary class has two generic type parameters: TKey and TValue.

4] When a generic class has multiple type parameters, they must all match - False

5] list.Add(item) - The Add() method is used to add items to a List object.

6] Remove and RemoveAt

7] You indicate that a class has a generic type parameter by using angle brackets (< >) after the class name.

8] Generic classes can only have one generic type parameter - False

9] Generic type constraints limit what can be used for the generic type - True

10] Constraints let you use the methods of the thing you are constraining to - True
